Moran 1927 – 1999 It is a rare leader whose legacy reaches from above to continually nurture, cajole and enthuse those individuals who were lucky to stand in the light of profound human wisdom. James A. Moran, our Founder, had an open and embracing attitude which he endorsed new ideas, but also the clarity of vision his years of accumulated experience could bring to the real estate discussion. He was a respected real estate Hall-of-Famer, with world-class rowing marathoner, Vince Lombardi footballer, Director of too many boards to list, loving husband, father and grandfather, devout Christian, unselfish mentor and Partner and proud Navy Veteran, Jim Regularly joked that he was personally responsible for ending WWII both in Europe and Asia. It was obvious to him, if not to others, that Germany surrendered the day he entered the Navy and Japan surrendered the day he shipped to the Pacific. The “Old Pro” was never one to lose himself in self-importance, nor would he tolerate egos in his associates, dismissing grandiose, and selfish behavior as so much noise useful only for obscuring the facts. Jim’s word and his great character were his reputation and his expressed wish was, “to die in his office, at 90 years of age, still actively making real estate deals.” Jim fell short of his goal, not because he lost the battle with his illness, but as he put it, he ran out of time.","leader":false,"inmemory":true},{"name":"Jimmy Pappas ","job":"Executive Vice President","org":"Investment Management","slug":"james-pappas","photo":"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6bc5ab851aeadfe3a90206/5f6cf708b235c2528ca5c99e_James%20Plato%20Pappas%20-%20(new%20site).jpg","linkedIn":"","description":"In memory of James Plato “Jimmy” Pappas 1959 – 2011 We give thanks for the life of Jimmy Pappas whose larger-than-life personality filled any room he entered. Jimmy was a “Man’s Man,” a true friend, a loving and selfless husband, father, son, brother and uncle, a dedicated leader, a man that could always be counted on, and above all, a man whose word was his bond and whose integrity was beyond reproach. First and foremost, Jimmy was a dedicated husband and father. He was incredibly proud of his family, his greatest joy. James Plato “Jimmy” Pappas, was born in Flushing, New York on the 28th of November 1959. He died on the 10th of September 2011, after a 14-month battle with Lymphoma. Jimmy faced cancer with a tremendous amount of courage and strength. Jimmy graduated from Memorial High School, Texas A&M University, Fightin’ Texas Aggie Class of ’81 and obtained an MBA from the University of Thomas. He was a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. Jimmy had a passion for real estate development and enjoyed working to improve the quality of life in communities through the Houston area. His work was an instrumental part of several well-known Houston master-planned developments, including New Territory, First Colony, CITYCENTRE, and most recently, Spring Trails. Jimmy worked hard and brought a contagious enthusiasm to everything he did. He always gave back and was active in the American Society of Civil Engineers and The Urban Land Institute. He served on the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo board, which raises money for children’s scholarships. Jimmy’s interests were curiously diverse. Whether it was racing offshore powerboats, scuba diving, hunting, fishing, cooking, the Greek Festival, driving his convertible, or even waxing poetically about the social worth of lawyers, he did it all with passion and was always “all in.” In every aspect of his life, Jimmy touched all with his unique engaging character, contagious excitement and understanding of the world and the people within it. He has left us with a good and honorable pattern to follow. He would say that it was “no big deal,” but with a mischievous grin you could see he was happy to make the world a better place for so many. Jimmy’s indelible mark on our community’s past and future will be with us always.","leader":false,"inmemory":true},{"name":"Joe Flores","job":"Assistant Property Manager","org":"Property Operations","slug":"joe-flores","photo":"https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f6bc5ab851aeadfe3a90206/5f6bc5ab851aea7de5a90490__0000s_0062_Joe%20Flores.jpg","linkedIn":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-flores-43762068/","description":"","leader":false,"inmemory":false},

He was sharp and spry up until he departed this life May 29, 2013, in Houston. Around Midway he was affectionately referred to as “Mr. John”. Mr. John was a Midway veteran who embodied our spirit of teamwork. After many years on the construction side of the business, he “retired” and became a jack of all trades at the Midway office – highly respected for his willingness to jump in on any project and do whatever it took to get the job done. Mr. John had an impeccable sense of style. No matter what he was doing his shirt and pants were always pressed – with extra starch – and his shoes shined like the sun. Many times, his look would be topped off with one of the various fedoras that he had procured over his lifetime. He had an infectious laugh, a smile that lit up a room, and a generous heart – always wanting to help and give. Working hard was just part of who he was – up until he physically couldn’t do it any longer John was a faithful man and never kept his love for our Lord a secret.
